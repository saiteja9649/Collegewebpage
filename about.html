          I really liked my college atmosphere as it looks so green with all the trees,the infrastructure in the college is very good.staff members are nice.Faculty in our college interact with us and teach us more things which are very useful for us in future,placements are good.extra curricular activities are also conducted.like annual days, traditional days and I also participated in sports like badminton as it helps us to refresh our minds and there is special place for playing cricket,football and basketball.But in our college we don't have technical fests as they may help in sharing ideas and their knowledge with each other.</div>
